# Nested Conditionals Practice

Time for something a little bit different.
<br/>I've given you a nested conditional that uses a variable called num.
<br/>I would like for you to change the value of num to another number,
<br/>so that "YOU GOT ME!" is printed out.
<br/>Don't change anything other than the value of num!
<br/>Leave the conditional alone!
