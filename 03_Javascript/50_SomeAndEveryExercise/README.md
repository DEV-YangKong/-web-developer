# Some/Every Exercise

Define a function called allEvens that accepts a single array of numbers.
<br/>
If the array contains all even numbers, return true.
<br/>
Otherwise, return false. Use some or every to help you do this! (only one of them is actually useful here)
<br/>

- allEvens([2,4,6,8]) //true
- allEvens([1,4,6,8]) //false
- allEvens([1,2,3]) //false
