# Treasure Island

This is my Treasure Island Python project.

## Introduction

Welcome to Treasure Island! Your mission is to find the hidden treasure on the island by making the right choices along the way.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script to start the game.

2. Follow the prompts and make choices by typing the corresponding keywords.

3. Explore the island, encounter challenges, and make decisions that will lead you to the treasure or result in a game over.

4. Enjoy the adventure and see if you can uncover the treasure!

## How to Run

To run the Treasure Island game, follow these steps:

1. Install Python on your computer if it is not already installed. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Save the Treasure Island Python script to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `treasure_island.py`).

3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   python treasure_island.py
   ```

## Play!

1. You start at a crossroad. Choose whether to go left or right.

   ```python
   You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right".
   ```

2. You come across a lake with an island. Choose whether to wait for a boat or swim across.

   ```python
   You've come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat or "swim" to swim across.
   ```

3. You arrive at the island. There are three doors: red, yellow, and blue. Choose a door color.

   ```python
   You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors: one red, one yellow, and one blue. Which color do you choose?
   ```

4. Based on the door color you chose, you will either find the treasure and win the game or face a game over scenario.

5. Enjoy the game and have fun exploring Treasure Island!
