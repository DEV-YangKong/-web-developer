# Password Generator Project

This is a simple Python program that generates random passwords based on user preferences.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `password_generator.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the criteria for your password.

## Usage

When you run the program, it will ask you for the following information:

- Number of letters: Enter the desired number of letters in your password.
- Number of symbols: Enter the desired number of symbols in your password.
- Number of numbers: Enter the desired number of numbers in your password.

Based on your input, the program will generate a password for you. It offers two levels of password complexity:

- Easy Level: The order of characters is not randomized.
- Hard Level: The order of characters is randomized.

After generating the password, the program will display it on the screen.

<em>Note: If you enter 0 for all criteria (letters, symbols, and numbers), the program will inform you that you did not enter the criteria for creating a password.</em>
