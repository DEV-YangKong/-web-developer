# 08 Hipster Logo Exercise

---

I'm opening up a very hip artisanal vodka company called Purple Grain. <br/>

Please help complete my incredibly ugly logo. Style the <h1> with the following styles: <br/>

uppercase all the letters, without touching the html! <br/>

(note: you weren't taught how to do this, you will need to flex your googling skills) <br/>

set the font-family to be 'monospace' <br/>

center align the text <br/>

set the font weight to 100 <br/>

make the text size 40px <br/>

set spacing between letters to 20px <br/>

add a wavy plum underline (plum is the color) - I can't test this, but make sure it looks like the image! <br/>
