# Object Access Exercise

In index.js, you'll find a restaurant object that contains a name, address, city, state, and zipcode. <br>

Your task to is to create a variable named fullAddress that points to a string using the information from restaurant. <br>

fullAddress should point to a string that includes the address, city, state, and zipcode from the restaurant object. <br>

Make sure to add any necessary commas or spaces between the values as seen in the exact expected output format shown below.<br>

To make it harder to "cheat" by copy and pasting, I've randomly generated the address portion. <br>

For example, if address was "64 Johnson Ave", the fullAddress variable would look like this:<br>

"64 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206" //<br>

this is the expected output format of the fullAddress string <br>

(keep an eye on the commas and/or spaces between the values and match that too!)
