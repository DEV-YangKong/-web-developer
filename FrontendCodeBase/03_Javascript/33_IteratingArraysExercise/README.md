# Iterating Arrays Exercise

I've provided you with an array of strings called people.<br/>
Loop over the people array with a for loop, printing out each name in uppercase letters.<br/>
Your result should look something like:<br/>

- SCOOBY
- VELMA
- DAPHNE
- SHAGGY
- FRED

<br/>
<em>Hint: use i from your loop as an array index!</em>
