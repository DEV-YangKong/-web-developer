# For...Of Practice

Let's practice using for...of.<br/>
I've provided you with an array called numbers.<br/>
Please use a for...of loop to loop over it, and print out the square of each value (the number multiplied by itself).<br/>

NOTES:<br/>

1. Udemy's coding exercise platform does NOT support the `**` operator.<br/>

2. You could accomplish this by using a while loop or a for loop, but please use a for...of loop!<br/>Unfortunately, I can't enforce the type of loop you use, but please I'm begging you to use a for...of.<br/>I will hunt you down if you don't.<br/>Thank you and have a great day!<br/>

Your output should look like this:<br/>

- 1
- 4
- 9
- 16
- 25
- 36
- 49
- 64
- 81
