# Multiple Args Exercise

In some dice games like Craps, a roll of two 1's is called "Snake Eyes".<br/>
It's generally not a good roll.<br/>
Please write a function called isSnakeEyes, which accepts two numbers as inputs, representing two dice.<br/>
If the two numbers are both 1's, please print "Snake Eyes!" otherwise print "Not Snake Eyes!"<br/>

- isSnakeEyes(1,1) //Snake Eyes!
- isSnakeEyes(1,5) //Not Snake Eyes!
- isSnakeEyes(4,5) //Not Snake Eyes!

<br/>
<em>Hint: Normally a function will return a value, but for the sake of having this work with the Udemy interpreter we will be using console.log() instead of return, to print the output.</em>
