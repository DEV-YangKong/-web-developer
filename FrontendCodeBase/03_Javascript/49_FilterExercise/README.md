# Filter Exercise

Let's get some practice using the filter method.<br/>
Write a function called validUserNames that accepts an array of usernames (strings).
<br/><strong>It should return a new array, containing only the usernames that are less than 10 characters.</strong>

<br/>
For example:
<br/>

- function validUserNames(['mark', 'staceysmom1978', 'q29832128238983', 'carrie98', 'MoanaFan']);
- // => ["mark", "carrie98", "MoanaFan"]

<br/>

<u>Note:</u> The syntax for this solution might be a little strange to you at this point in the course because it requires you to write the code, that you just learned in the previous lecture, inside of a function. e.g.,

- function validUserNames(usernames) {
  // your code here
  }

<br/>

or if you want to get fancy with an arrow function:
<br/>

- const validUserNames = usernames => // your code here;

<br/>

There is no need to define an actual array of usernames, that part is done for you behind the scenes.
