# Todo List

This is a simple Todo List app implemented in HTML and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding new todos, listing all existing todos, and removing specific todos.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `todos.js` and `index.html` files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. You will see the Todo List interface with the following options:

   - "new" - Add a new Todo
   - "list" - List all Todos
   - "del" - Remove a specific Todo
   - "quit" or "q" - Quit the app

4. Enter your choice by typing one of the available options and pressing Enter.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to add, list, or delete todos.
6. To quit the app, type "quit" or "q" when prompted for your choice.

## Example

Suppose you add a few todos and then list them:

```plaintext
> new
Enter new Todo: Buy groceries
Buy groceries added to list

> new
Enter new Todo: Read a book
Read a book added to list

> new
Enter new Todo: Clean the room
Clean the room added to list
