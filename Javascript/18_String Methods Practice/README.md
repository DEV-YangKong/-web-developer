# String Methods Practice

---

Let's get some practice working with string methods. <br/>
I've provided you with a variable in index. <br/>
js called message. <br/>
Without altering the original value stored in message, <br/>
please define a variable called whisper that is a lowercased version of message,
with all the extra space at the beginning and end removed. <br/>
You will need to use two string methods that we just covered. <br/>
Don't forget you can chain them together on a single line!
