# Our First Conditional Exercise

---

Let's get some practice with conditional statements! <br/>
In order to make your code repeatable and testable, <br/>
I'm asking you to write your code inside a pre-defined function <br/>
(something we have not yet covered in the course). <br/>

- Write your code between the two comments in index.js

- You will automatically have access to a variable called num.
  <br/>
  <strong> Please do not try and define num or change num in any way! </strong><br/>

I will be setting the value of num when I test your code, so that I can test different outcomes<br/>

<strong>If num is an even number, print out "even". Don't do anything if num is an odd number.</strong>
