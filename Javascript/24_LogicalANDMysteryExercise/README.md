# Logical AND Mystery Exercise

I've provided you with a conditional statement that uses a variable called mystery.
<br/>Please change the value of mystery so that the conditional is true
<br/>and "YOU GOT IT" is printed to the console.  
<br/>Do not change anything other than the value of mystery on line 1!
