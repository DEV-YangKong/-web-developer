# 09 Basic Selectors Practice

It's time to get some practice with the new CSS Selectors we just learned. <br/>

Without touching any of the starter HTML code in index.html, write CSS in app.css according to these rules: <br/>

Give all li elements the text color blue <br/>

Give all elements with the class of done the text color grey <br/>

Give the element with the id clear a red background and white text <br/>
