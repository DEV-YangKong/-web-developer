# 11 Checkerboard Exercise

---

The index.html file contains 25 'div' elements, each with the class of square. <br/>

Please create a simple checkerboard pattern by making the even squares black and the odd squares red. <br/>

Your result should look like the image below. <br/>

Please write your styles in app.css, and do not change any of the styles in NO_TOUCHING.css <br/>

Please note: <br/>

the solution needs to select both the even and odd squares, <br/>

changing the background color of the entire board will work visually, <br/>

but will not pass the exercise parameters. <br/>
