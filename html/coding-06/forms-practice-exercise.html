Let's get some practice with forms, inputs, labels, and buttons! Write a simple form with the following inputs:

Username

Text Input

Should have placeholder text of 'username'

Make sure to properly label the input (using id/for attributes)

Password

Password Input

Should have placeholder text of 'password'

Make sure to properly label the input (using id/for attributes)

A Button

With the inner text 'Register'

<form>
  <div>
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input type="text" name="username" id="username" placeholder="username" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input
      type="password"
      name="password"
      id="password"
      placeholder="password"
    />
  </div>
  <button>Register</button>
</form>
